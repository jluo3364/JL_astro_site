As a team of four, we developed a comprehensive online auction platform with three core functionalities:

I. Auctions Management: Sellers can create auctions and list items for sale, setting various parameters such as item characteristics, closing date, and a hidden minimum price. Buyers can bid on items, with options for manual or automatic bidding. The system alerts users of higher bids and determines the auction winner based on set criteria, considering reserve prices if applicable.

II. Browsing and Advanced Search: Users can browse items, view current bidding status, and sort/search by different criteria. Additionally, they can access bid history, view auctions participated in by specific users, and receive alerts for items of interest. The platform also offers browsing of past auctions and relevant information.

III. Admin and Customer Support: Administrators have control over user accounts and generate sales reports, while customer representatives handle user inquiries, manage account information, and oversee auction activities.
